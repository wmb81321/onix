# Convexo P2P — Project Memory

Convexo P2P is an agentic P2P crypto-fiat settlement app. An AI Agent coordinates trades between unknown counterparties using Tempo's native primitives. Crypto escrow is handled via Tempo Virtual Addresses (TIP-20 native deposit attribution that auto-forwards to a master wallet); fiat moves **directly between counterparties** (Zelle, Venmo, bank transfer, wire, etc.); the seller confirms receipt in the app and the agent then releases USDC on-chain. The 0.1 USDC service fee is charged via MPP (`mppx`) at **order creation** — the order creator pays once and the fee is forfeited on cancel or expiry. No Stripe, no custom Solidity, no TEE, no ERC-8004, no Privy in the MVP — Tempo Wallet, Virtual Addresses, MPP, and Supabase carry the full stack.

### Why two deployments?

The **agent** needs a persistent long-running process (deposit monitor, on-chain signing). Vercel serverless functions time out and can't maintain state. The **frontend** calls the agent via `FACILITATOR_URL` (server-only env var, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`).

## Stack

| Layer | Tech | Key Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| User wallet | Tempo Wallet (`tempoWallet()` wagmi connector) | Import `tempoModerato` from `viem/chains`, `tempoWallet` from `wagmi/connectors` |
| Deposits | TIP-20 Virtual Addresses | `VirtualAddress.from({ masterId, userTag: tradeId })` — userTag never reused |
| Agent wallet | Tempo master wallet + access keys | `AGENT_MASTER_ID` immutable; access keys carry `maxSpend` + `expiry` |
| Service fee | MPP session via `mppx` | `mppx['tempo/charge']({ amount: '0.1', externalId: tradeId })` |
| Buyer fiat | **Direct counterparty payment** (Zelle/Venmo/Wire/Bank/CashApp/PayPal/Other) | Buyer marks sent with method + reference + optional proof URL |
| Seller payout | **Direct counterparty payment** | Seller confirms receipt manually; trust + ratings replace escrow |
| Release trigger | Seller-confirmed receipt | `confirmPayment()` checks `seller_address`, then transfers USDC on-chain |
| On-chain transfer | viem `transferUsdc` from agent EOA | Single-tx, sub-second finality on Tempo |
| Balance reading | `Hooks.token.useGetBalance` from `wagmi/tempo` | Not `useReadContract` — native TIP-20 hook |
| Testnet faucet | `Hooks.faucet.useFundSync` from `wagmi/tempo` | In-app, no redirect, testnet only |
| Order book | Supabase Realtime + Postgres | RLS on every table; anon key in browser only |
| Frontend | Next.js 15 App Router | Service-role key never in browser bundles |
| Agent | TypeScript / Node.js | Idempotent; Supabase write before every side-effect |

## Database Schema (7 migrations)

| Migration | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `001_schema.sql` | `users`, `orders`, `trades`, `ratings` tables + enums |
| `002_rls.sql` | Row-level security policies |
| `003_stripe_payment_intent.sql` | `trades.stripe_payment_intent_id` (legacy, unused in v2.0) |
| `004_link_fields.sql` | `trades.link_spend_request_id`, `users.link_payment_method_id` (legacy) |
| `005_buyer_payment_method.sql` | `users.stripe_customer_id` etc. (legacy) |
| `006_manual_payment.sql` | New trade statuses (`payment_sent`, `payment_confirmed`, `disputed`); `trades.payment_method`, `payment_reference`, `payment_proof_url`, `payment_sent_at`, `payment_confirmed_at`; `users.payment_methods` jsonb |

Legacy Stripe columns (`stripe_account`, `link_payment_method_id`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_buyer_pm_id`, `stripe_buyer_card_brand`, `stripe_buyer_card_last4`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `link_spend_request_id`, `stripe_payout_id`, `stripe_account_id`) remain in the schema for backward compatibility but are NOT written by any v2.0 code path. They will be dropped in a future migration.

## Trade State Machine

```
created → deposited → payment_sent → payment_confirmed → released → complete
```

**Agent entry points (no global Bearer gate — address in body IS identity):**
- `POST /trades/:id/payment-sent` (`buyer_address` in body verified against trade row) → `markPaymentSent()` → `payment_sent`
- `POST /trades/:id/confirm-payment` (`seller_address` in body verified against trade row) → `confirmPayment()` → `payment_confirmed` → on-chain `transferUsdc` → `released` → `complete`
- `POST /trades/:id/settle` (Bearer auth, deprecated) → `markPaymentSent()` with `method='x402'`, then still requires `confirm-payment` to release USDC

**Failure states:** `deposit_timeout` (30 min), `disputed`, `refunded`

**Legacy statuses kept on the enum for backward compat with old rows:** `fee_paid`, `fiat_sent`, `stripe_failed` — never written by v2.0 code.

All transitions write Supabase BEFORE the side-effect runs.

## The Flow

### SELL order match (seller posts, buyer matches)
1. Seller posts SELL order on `/orderbook` (and ideally has at least one entry in `/account` → Payment Methods so the buyer sees it).
2. Buyer matches → agent creates trade, derives virtual deposit address, locks the order.
3. Seller deposits USDC to the virtual address → auto-forwards to master wallet → trade transitions to `deposited`.
4. Buyer opens `/trades/[id]`, sees the seller's payment methods (Zelle/Venmo/Wire/etc.), pays the seller off-platform with the agreed USD amount.
5. Buyer fills `PaymentSentForm` (method + reference number + optional proof URL) → `POST /api/trades/[id]/payment-sent` → trade transitions to `payment_sent`.
6. Seller opens `/trades/[id]`, sees `ConfirmPaymentPanel` with the buyer's payment details, verifies the funds arrived in their account.
7. Seller clicks "I received $X — Release USDC" → `POST /api/trades/[id]/confirm-payment` → trade transitions to `payment_confirmed` → agent transfers USDC on-chain to buyer → `released` → `complete`.
8. Both parties rate each other (1-5 stars).

### BUY order match (roles swapped)
- Order poster = buyer (wants USDC, will pay USD).
- Matcher = seller (deposits USDC, receives USD).
- Same agent flow from step 3 onward.

### Agent-native crypto path (no UI, x402)
1. Agent observes `deposited` trade via the public order/trade APIs.
2. Agent calls `POST /api/trades/:id/settle` — receives 402 with mppx challenge.
3. Agent pays 0.1 USDC via mppx, retries — agent marks `payment_sent` with `method='x402'`, `reference=tradeId`.
4. Seller (human or another agent) still needs to call `POST /trades/:id/confirm-payment` to actually release USDC. The x402 payment IS proof-of-fee but NOT proof-of-fiat-receipt.

## API Surface (all endpoints)

### Agent (Railway)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | public | Health check, returns `{ status: 'ok', version: '2.1.0' }` |
| POST | `/orders` | **public** (mppx 402) | Pay 0.1 USDC service fee → creates order + derives per-order virtual deposit address |
| POST | `/orders/:id/cancel` | address-verified | Requester address must match order creator; DB-only cancel; VA persists; fee forfeited |
| POST | `/trades` | address-verified | Creates trade; buyer address in body matched against order |
| POST | `/trades/:id/payment-sent` | address-verified | `buyer_address` in body verified against trade; marks fiat sent → `payment_sent` |
| POST | `/trades/:id/confirm-payment` | address-verified | `seller_address` in body verified against trade; releases USDC → `complete` |
| POST | `/trades/:id/settle` | Bearer | **Deprecated** — marks `payment_sent` with `method='x402'`, no fee charged. Use `payment-sent` for new integrations. |

### Frontend proxy (Next.js — server-side, no browser auth needed)

| GET | `/api/orders/by-user` | Orders for a wallet (service-role read) |
| POST | `/api/trades` | Create trade (forwards to agent) |
| GET | `/api/trades/[id]` | Fetch trade from Supabase |
| POST | `/api/trades/[id]/settle` | Forward to agent settle (deprecated) |
| POST | `/api/trades/[id]/payment-sent` | Forward to agent payment-sent |

| POST | `/api/users/payment-methods` | Save/replace seller's payment methods array |

### Removed in v2.0 (now return 410 Gone)

`POST /api/stripe/account`, `GET /api/stripe/account-status`, `GET /api/stripe/account/refresh`, `POST /api/stripe/setup-intent`, `POST /api/stripe/payment-method/save`, `POST /api/users/link-pm`, `DELETE /api/users/link-pm`, `POST /api/trades/[id]/link-pay`, `POST /api/trades/[id]/auto-pay`, `POST /api/trades/[id]/payment-intent`. Agent route `POST /webhooks/stripe` is gone entirely (the Stripe webhook in their dashboard is dead).

## Hard Rules for Claude Code

1. **`AGENT_MASTER_ID` is sacred.** Never recompute, never lose.
2. **USDC release ONLY after the seller calls `confirmPayment()` (or the trade reaches `payment_confirmed` by another verified path).** No bypass — the seller signature is the trust anchor in v2.0.
3. **Supabase state written BEFORE every on-chain side-effect.** Crash-recoverable.
4. **MPP amounts in TIP-20 stablecoins.** Never hardcode; read from `CHARGE_AMOUNT_USDC` env.
5. **The seller's address (from the trade row) is the only address allowed to call `/confirm-payment`.** `flowManual.confirmPayment` enforces this; never weaken it.
6. **Access keys carry `maxSpend` and `expiry`.** Never use master passkey programmatically.
7. **No service-role Supabase key in browser-shipped code.**
8. **Never `balanceOf(virtualAddress)`.** Watch `Transfer` events with `to === virtualAddress`.
9. **All HTTP 402 via `mppx`.** Never implement the challenge/response manually.
10. **Deposit timeout: 30 minutes.**
11. **`CHANGELOG.md` updated after every meaningful change.**
12. **`Hooks.token.useGetBalance` from `wagmi/tempo`** for TIP-20 balance reads.
13. **`Hooks.faucet.useFundSync` from `wagmi/tempo`** for testnet faucet.
13a. **`Hooks.token.useTransferSync` from `wagmi/tempo`** for in-app TIP-20 transfers (e.g. seller deposit to virtual address). Never use raw `viem` `writeContract` for user-facing transfers — the hook handles passkey signing and gas sponsorship correctly.
13b. **mppx client must use `mode: 'push'`** when the user wallet is a Tempo passkey wallet. Pull mode (`signTransaction` path) is incompatible — Tempo passkey wallets always attach a `feePayerSignature` using passkey crypto that Revm's ECDSA recovery cannot verify. Never set `mode: 'pull'` or remove `mode: 'push'` from `place-order-modal.tsx`. On the agent side, never set `feePayer: true` in `tempo.charge` — it causes `FeePayerValidationError: rejected fields: feePayerSignature`.
14. **`POST /orders` is public** — mppx 0.1 USDC payment IS the auth. The fee is charged once at order creation and forfeited on cancel or expiry. `POST /trades/:id/settle` is **Bearer-auth only** (deprecated; no fee charged there anymore).
15. **No global Bearer gate on payment endpoints.** `POST /orders/:id/cancel` verifies `requester_address` against `order.creator_address`; `POST /trades/:id/payment-sent` verifies `buyer_address`; `POST /trades/:id/confirm-payment` verifies `seller_address`. Address-in-body IS the identity proof — never re-add a global API key check to these routes.
15a. **Virtual deposit address is per-order, not per-trade.** `deriveDepositAddress(masterId, orderId)` is called in `POST /orders`; `POST /trades` reads the VA from the order row. Never re-derive from `tradeId`.
16. **State machine transitions are idempotent.** Re-calling `markPaymentSent` or `confirmPayment` for a trade already past that state must be a no-op, not a duplicate side-effect.
17. **No new Stripe code.** Stripe is intentionally absent. If a payment rail expansion is needed later, build it as `flowB.ts` next to `flowManual.ts` — do not resurrect `flowA.ts`.
